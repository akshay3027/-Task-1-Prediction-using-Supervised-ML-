# TASK-1 :- Prediction using Supervised ML
Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is one that has both input and output parameters. In this type of learning both training and validation, datasets are labelled

# Problem Statement :
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
## Dataset - http://bit.ly/w-data

# Solution :

Simple Linear Regression is performed with the train-test-split technique for Machine Learning implementation. Also, a scatter plot with the regression line is plotted. At the end the error of the model is calculated.
